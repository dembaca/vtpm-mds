## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Refuse An Instance Identity To Callers With No VM Record

The service SHALL read `mds.require_vm_identity`, whose built-in default is
true.

When it is true, every handler that reports the caller's *instance identity*
SHALL require the request's connection to be bound to a VM record by the
`vm-inventory` capability, and SHALL refuse the request when it is not. Exactly
these paths SHALL be refused:

- `GET /latest/meta-data/instance-id`
- `GET /latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document`
- `GET /latest/dynamic/instance-identity/signature`

The signature endpoint is refused with the document although it serves a
constant: the two form one feature, and a detached signature over a document
the caller cannot obtain reports nothing.

The remaining metadata paths SHALL NOT be refused, because none of them asserts
an identity the service vouches for. `local-hostname` echoes the caller's own
`Host` header, `local-ipv4` reports the caller's own peer address,
`placement/availability-zone` and `services/domain` are fixed strings,
`public-ipv4` is always unavailable, and the index is a static listing. An
unbound caller SHALL continue to be served all of them, and the index SHALL
continue to list `instance-id` even though reading it will be refused.

The refusal SHALL be checked after the session token is validated and before
any instance value is derived, and SHALL be answered `404` with the body
`404 page not found` — byte for byte what the catch-all handler returns for an
unregistered route. An unbound caller SHALL therefore not be able to tell a
refused endpoint from one that does not exist. The service SHALL log each
refusal with the caller's peer address, so an operator can.

`PUT /latest/api/token` and `GET /health` SHALL NOT be affected: both remain
unauthenticated and are served to any caller, bound or not.

When `mds.require_vm_identity` is false none of these paths SHALL be refused,
and the instance identity SHALL be derived as specified by
`Derive The Instance Id From The Bound VM Record`.

#### Scenario: Unbound caller is refused the instance id

- **GIVEN** `mds.require_vm_identity` is true, a valid session token, and a
  caller that `vm-inventory` could not bind to any VM record
- **WHEN** it sends `GET /latest/meta-data/instance-id`
- **THEN** the response is `404` with the body `404 page not found`

#### Scenario: Refusal is indistinguishable from an unknown route

- **GIVEN** an unbound caller with a valid session token
- **WHEN** it sends `GET /latest/meta-data/instance-id` and
  `GET /latest/no-such-thing`
- **THEN** both responses are `404` with the body `404 page not found`

#### Scenario: Unbound caller is refused both instance identity endpoints

- **GIVEN** `mds.require_vm_identity` is true and an unbound caller with a
  valid session token
- **WHEN** it sends `GET /latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document` and
  `GET /latest/dynamic/instance-identity/signature`
- **THEN** both responses are `404`

#### Scenario: Unbound caller keeps the caller-derived metadata

- **GIVEN** `mds.require_vm_identity` is true and an unbound caller from
  `10.0.0.5` with a valid session token
- **WHEN** it sends `GET /latest/meta-data/`,
  `GET /latest/meta-data/local-hostname`,
  `GET /latest/meta-data/local-ipv4`,
  `GET /latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone` and
  `GET /latest/meta-data/services/domain`
- **THEN** every response is `200`, `local-ipv4` is `10.0.0.5`, and the index
  still lists `instance-id`

#### Scenario: Bound caller is unaffected

- **GIVEN** `mds.require_vm_identity` is true and a caller bound to VM `100`
- **WHEN** it reads the metadata tree with a valid session token
- **THEN** every value is served exactly as it is without the setting

#### Scenario: Token and health endpoints stay open

- **GIVEN** `mds.require_vm_identity` is true and an unbound caller
- **WHEN** it sends `PUT /latest/api/token` and `GET /health`
- **THEN** both respond `200`

#### Scenario: A missing token is still answered as a missing token

- **GIVEN** `mds.require_vm_identity` is true and an unbound caller with no
  session token
- **WHEN** it sends `GET /latest/meta-data/instance-id`
- **THEN** the response is `401` with the body `IMDSv2 token required`,
  because the token check runs first
